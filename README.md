# NSGAII with wrapper and analytics
An implementation of Deb's NSGAII in C/C++ with the following features:

1. Mixing of integer and floating point decision varioables;
2. Ability to associate properties with decision variable values for use in objective function evaluation
2. Creep Mutation;
3. Includes a wrapper for linking to external objective function executables; and
4. Displays/prints statistics of the search behaviour

These features have been developed at the University of Adelaide by Wenyan Wu, Holger Maier, Angus Simpson, and Jeffrey Newman.
